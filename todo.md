# master TODO list
## critical
- [x] fix bug with data not being saved
- [x] double check implementation of output level flags
- [x] fix `pyutil/plot/pos.py pos_multi`
- [ ] write & test angle fitness function
- [ ] fix code for running on cluster
- [ ] get diffusion stuff working
## org
- [x] fix and incorporate TODO scraper
- [ ] get docs working
- [ ] reorg source files into `src/` dir?
## params writing
 - [ ] save genetic run info to `params.json` when generating:
   - [ ] ModParams
   - [ ] genetic run id
   - [ ] generation id
   - [ ] individual id
   - [ ] eval runs params
## reading existing runs
 - [ ] error checking in validating params

# Yash To-Do 2021-11-17
  - [ ] neuron states - check with Michael on this
  - [ ] heat map, look at with algorithm - Michael did  
  - [ ] eliminate shootoff after hitting wall (by time and by checking coll objs tsv file)
  - [ ] plot foodPos y-value and x-value sweep_params but w/ 10 runs and blue X's for each one
  
# Yash To-Do 2021-10-21
  - [X] remove legend in sweep_params plots. Check plt.legend in pos_multi
  - [X] move foodPos up and down, manipulating y-coordinate
  - [X] move foodPos x-value, but closer to default value x=.005 like .0055. Use sweep_params

look into this for writing data

try $$e^{-x}$$ as a loss func

connection keys can't be seamlessly turned into NamedTuples because `from` is a python keyword. So, at some point I should go in and change the 'from'/'to' to something else, and then the python code can be cleaned up a bit and made type checkable

color gradient for plots: things to change in pos_multi

- add extra parameter to `pos_multi` which will determine how the read parameter sets are sorted- split the read-plot loop in two (for x_dir in lst_dirs ..)
- first time we loop, read all the data
- after first loop, sort the data by the given parameter and create a corresponding colormap using something like `colors = cm.plasma(np.linspace(0,1,n_tracks))`
- loop over the sortedÂ data again, and use the colormap to determine both the food color and track color
